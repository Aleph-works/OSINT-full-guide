# OSINT-full-guide
Hey Folks! I made this repostory to share with you how I conduct a detailed OSINT investigation and to share my notes and checklist. We call these type of engagements INVESTIGATIONS or RESEARCHES not assesments, because you should NEVER interact directly with your target. Also I suggest you to open up the checklist and follow along with the explaination

DISCLAIMER: Only conduct an OSINT research if you have explicit permission to do so. Use the tools and techniques at your own responsability. I am not accountable for any possible damage you make.

# Business OSINT

First things first, sign a contract with the client. Only start you work when you have the legal parts covered.

After that research the company using Google, DuckDuckGo, Yandex to get context. What services/products they offer? Size of the company, possible geolocation, registry data?
In this phase you have to recollect all the socials of your target: websites, LinkedIn, Facebook page, Instagram...

Here you can find two great tools to see where a company was registered, the founders, addresses...etc

Using LinkedIn and the website of the company get a list about it's employees. Collect names, email-addresses, phone numbers, websites, everything. Don't worry if you did not find everything, later you will expand this list using additional tools. Using the newly obtained information and the one that you got from the registry you can easily recreate the chain of command of your target. I prefer to use Maltego, but use whatever graphing tool you like.

Download photos from the company's website and socials and extract metadata from them.

You can use https://imginn.com/ to download all the stories from Instagram.
